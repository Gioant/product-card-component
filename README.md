This is a solution to the [Product card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). 
Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements



### Notes

This was my first time solving a challenge on the Frontend Mentor site. I did not know they had a style guide provided, so everything here I basically eye-balled it.

Although I did not have the exact colors or font.. it is pretty close to the design provided.
